In this directory will be code for building lablqt with autogenerated bindings.

Use executable in ../xml to generate code. 
Generated code you'l find in ../xml/out. Make symlink from ../xml/out to ./out.

Do `make -C out/cpp` to compile C++ bidings code.

Do `make` to create lablqt.cma and dlllablqt.so.
