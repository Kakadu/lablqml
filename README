My thoughts about which bindings for qt should be

./xml --- binding generator
./moc --- helper utility to define user slots
./simple_signals --- hand-written bindings (only proof-of-concept)
./test_gen       --- environment for compiling bindings from generated code
./xmltool        --- a tool for simplifying XML api

You can use build.ml script for pseudo-autobuidld.

aaa.xml is XML API representation of QtCore and QtGui namespaces in Qt 4.7.3 (Debian testing).
