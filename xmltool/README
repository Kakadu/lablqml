It is very simple tool filter a big xml APIs. I filters classes only if second level of XML (children of `code` node).

Thing which are not so simple.
1) I we include a class all base class are included too.
2) TODO: fix current name comparation to lower-case compareation (to avoid user spelling mistakes)
3) TODO: improve classes names specifiction. Added some decalrations like  Qt::Win*
